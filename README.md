# afr-starter
Random tiny axios / fs / readline starter kit for mostly quick local stuff.

Doesn't really do anything useful atm, but you can clone and install and start filling it out if you need such a tool.

### Steps
+ Clone and run `npm i`.
+ Checkout sample `.csv` or setup a request to an API (currently hits PokeAPI).
